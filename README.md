# Green-Ai-Fraud-Detection
This is a novel hybrid Deep Learning project to combat financial fraud. It combines SNNs for ultra-efficient initial pattern detection with conventional neural networks, and incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. This approach delivers reductions in energy consumption, while maintaining high accuracy and providing interpretable results.
